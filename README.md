# ðŸŽ¶ Analyzing Song Popularity Using Spotifyâ€™s Audio Features 

ðŸŽµ Out of curiosity of different components of music as well as potential associations between music features and song popularity, this analysis investigates the relationship between music data - specifically audio features from the Spotifyâ€™s database, such as tempo and loudness - and song popularity measured by Spotifyâ€™s popularity index. 

ðŸŽ¸ The research analyzes over 160, 000 tracks from 1921 to 2020 with a variety of music related features collected from Spotifyâ€™s database API. The analysis applies methods including but not limited to: preliminary feature screening using exploratory data analysis (EDA), model fitting using proportional odds and multinomial logistic models, model selection using AIC, deviance, and ANOVA test, and model validation using binned residuals plot, accuracy scores, and AUC. 

ðŸŽ¹ The final model shows that there is evidence suggesting certain audio features, such as acousticness and danceability, affect song popularity more than other elements, such as key or mode. This research can serve as a reference to Spotify as they continue to develop their song database and hit song analysis, which could aid in new value creation.
